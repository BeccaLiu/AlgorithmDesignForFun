 * Created by rliu on 1/2/17.
 * 287. Find the Duplicate Number
 * Binary Serach/Two Pointer
 * Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * 1.You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
 * 2.You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
 * 3.Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
 * 4.There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

    //Analysis:
    //solution 0: native, iterate the list using 2 for loop, check if arr[i]==arr[j], which take O(n2) space, against third requirement
    //solution 1: sort the array, and scan once to find the duplicate, take O(nlogn)time, and take O(1) space, However against the first requirement: can not modified the array
    //solution 2: use a O(n) space array, set initial with True, scan the array, if arr[i]=False, set it to True, if it is already True, find the duplicate, however, against second requirement
    //requirement 3: if the runtime is less than O(n2), we may guess the running time is O(nlogn) or O(n) with O(1) space, however, I think O(nlogn) is more possible
    //a common algorithm with O(nlogn) is binary search
